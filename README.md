# CS300-
In these projects, I focused on analyzing and implementing data structures and algorithms to solve problems related to efficiency and organization. Project One involved evaluating the run-time and memory usage of different data structures, which reinforced the importance of choosing the right structure to balance performance and resource management. Project Two required developing code to sort and print a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order, applying sorting algorithms to achieve accurate and efficient results. Together, these projects demonstrated how fundamental data structure choices directly affect the effectiveness of a program.

Throughout the course, I learned to approach problems by first analyzing requirements, then selecting data structures that best fit those needs. When I encountered roadblocks, such as debugging logic errors or refining my sorting approach, I relied on testing, revisiting documentation, and breaking problems down into smaller steps. This process expanded my perspective on designing software by showing me that maintainable and adaptable code depends not just on functionality but also on clarity and structure. As a result, I have grown more intentional in writing programs that are both efficient and easy to read, making future modifications simpler and more reliable.
